# Welcome to Homework 2 - CMSC408 - Fall 2025

## Sources

[GitHub](https://github.com/zalando/zalando-howto-open-source/blob/master/READMEtemplate.md#readme) For README template

[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) For further explanations of Chen and Crows Foot diagrams and their syntax.

[Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) For Quarto markdown syntax and usage.

## Instructions

You must edit ``report.qmd`` in the ``./reports`` folder to make it your own. You must remove, at minimum, and replace any sections that are specific to Homework 2. Additionally, you must choose three problems from the homework assignment and provide provide Chen and Crow's Foot diagrams for each of the three problems with descriptions of the diagrams.

Following that you must discuss design assumptions and difficulties you encountered for each of the three problems, add relation sets (including a primary key for each relation set), and lastly, you must edit the README.md file to make it your own.

Once you finish editing the ``report.qmd`` file, you must render it to produce a ``report.html`` file. You may do this by running the ***quarto render*** command to render all files in the ``./reports`` folder, or by using the ***quarto render (filename)*** command, replacing filename with your filename and removing the brackets, to render individual files. Remember to make sure that you are in the ``./reports`` folder when you run the command. If you are not in the ``./reports`` folder, you will need to change directories to get there using the ***cd*** command followed by the path ``./reports``.

In order to to transform the ``report.qmd`` file into a ``report.html`` file, you will need to use one of the ***quarto render*** commands.

## Files and Folders

``./reports`` - contains the scaffold QMD file Homework 2. Your job is to modify this document and render it to *html*. The *html* file will be created in the same ``./reports`` folder.

This is a scaffold project. I’ll be providing scaffolds throughout the
semester to get you working faster, and to make grading much easier for
the TA team.
