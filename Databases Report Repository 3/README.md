## 📘 Overview

This project demonstrates the design of **Entity-Relationship (ER) models** using **Quarto**, **Graphviz (DOT)**, and **Mermaid**.  
Each model represents a real-world system and includes Chen and Crow’s Foot diagrams to visualize entities, relationships, cardinality, and participation.  

The assignment focuses on building a deeper understanding of how conceptual models translate into relational schemas while showcasing how Quarto can be used for technical documentation and database design reports.

## 🧩 Tools and Technologies

This project uses:  
- **Quarto** for rendering Markdown, diagrams, and reflections into a single report  
- **Graphviz (DOT)** for Chen-style diagrams  
- **Mermaid** for Crow’s Foot diagrams  
- **HTML output** for a fully self-contained and shareable final document

## 🧪 Rendering Instructions

To render the report, run:

quarto render report.qmd

or simply open the report.html file in a web browser.

## 💡 Reflection

This assignment was a valuable exercise in understanding the nuances of ER modeling. Creating both Chen and Crow’s Foot diagrams helped solidify my grasp of how different notations can represent the same underlying concepts. Using Quarto to compile everything into a cohesive document was particularly rewarding, as it allowed me to present my work professionally.
